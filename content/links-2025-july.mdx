## Philosophy & Ethics
- [Is AI Productivity Worth Our Humanity?](https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/is-ai-productivity-worth-our-humanity-with-prof-michael-sandel) - In this podcast episode, Michael Sandel and Tristan Harris discuss how AI-driven productivity and automation may deepen inequality, threaten human dignity, and challenge democracy if society values productivity above all else, urging a more humane direction for the AI revolution.
- [Justice](https://www.amazon.com/Justice-Whats-Right-Thing/dp/B00CCTH6U4/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3LOKQJE1V5V2P&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZxK6RpQiJZxqT-3juximP0mDXvcKI02x-5meMAvj9q6ssW5oQ8FRzeIYpj7KVmb4vQU1hWrgUJ3vLK4jKMq5iDOUjKnf_bh0WbsdT8sjhr158X-9y7UO2pfS31A4Esl_LbO-ZjQIS6VrhfCkoYoq7tOmcItqwfxBn8BSExS1jcmvtMvZCLsr86bSSSMaLwY7iiD1gbYI8f_dYaDECaEA9pDjkGucPQ-ulYOmOr4d4e8.AWxuvgEloF8Dcx5CeB3Nl4SrvrgNHGsw21128Wef69s&dib_tag=se&keywords=justice+michael+sandel&qid=1752417795&sprefix=justice+sandel%2Caps%2C183&sr=8-5) explores major philosophical theories of justice—such as utilitarianism, libertarianism, and communitarianism—using real-world dilemmas to challenge readers to consider what it truly means to create a just society

## Cognitive Science & Learning
- [Cognitive Tools for Making the Invisible Visible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF3XJT9YKpM) - Prof. Judy Fan discusses how cognitive tools help us understand complex visual information and make sense of the world. She explores the importance of visual abstraction in communication and scientific reasoning. Her work highlights how humans and technology can use visual representations to explain and discover knowledge.
- [Double loop learning in organizations](https://www.academia.edu/download/33422921/08_Argyris_doublelooplearning.pdf) - Learned of this concept from Prof. John Sterman's [Introduction to System Dynamics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-871-introduction-to-system-dynamics-fall-2013/) course and keep coming back to it. Double-loop learning is a concept developed by Chris Argyris, where individuals or organizations not only correct errors by adjusting their actions (single-loop learning) but also question and modify the underlying assumptions, values, and policies that guide those actions, leading to deeper, transformative learning and change. This is a foundational concept for long-term adaptability, innovation, and resilience in rapidly changing environments.

## Software & User Agency
- [Protoype of talking programs](https://x.com/alexobenauer/status/1787898486471512188) Alexander Obenauer shared a prototype exploring an environment where separate programs can "donate" specific data to an underlying system. This concept aims to enable more integrated data sharing between applications, allowing the system to utilize donated data for broader functionality or user benefit. Someone in the comments mentioned that the interface reminded them of [Natto.dev](https://natto.dev/) which is a fun aside. 
- [Malleable software: Restoring user agency in a world of locked-down apps](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/malleable-software/) calls for a future where software is as adaptable as physical tools, empowering users to reshape digital environments to fit their needs—without requiring programming skills. It advocates for incremental customization, interoperable tools, and collaborative creation, challenging today's rigid, locked-down apps and envisioning software that restores true user agency.
